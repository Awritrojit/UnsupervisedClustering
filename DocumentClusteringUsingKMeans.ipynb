    "In the above plot we show that heterogeneity goes down as we increase the number of clusters. Does this mean we should always favor a higher K? **Not at all!** As we will see in the following section, setting K too high may end up separating data points that are actually pretty alike. At the extreme, we can set individual data points to be their own clusters (K=N) and achieve zero heterogeneity, but separating each data point into its own cluster is hardly a desirable outcome. In the following section, we will learn how to detect a K set \"too large\"."

This naturally trades off between trying to minimize heterogeneity, but reduce model complexity.  In the heterogeneity versus K plot made above, we did not yet really see a flattening out of the heterogeneity, which might indicate that indeed K=100 is \"reasonable\" and we only see real overfitting for larger values of K (which are even harder to visualize using the methods we attempted above.)"
